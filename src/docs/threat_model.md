## Potential Threats and Mitigations

### 1. SQL Injection
**Risk Level**: Critical
**Description**: Attackers might attempt to inject malicious SQL code through user inputs.
**Mitigation**:
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Implement ORM with proper escaping
- Input validation and sanitization
- Least privilege database user accounts
- Regular database security scans using tools like SQLMap
- Database activity monitoring

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: Attackers might inject client-side scripts into pages viewed by other users.
**Mitigation**:
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- Use React's built-in XSS protection
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Regular scanning with OWASP ZAP to detect XSS vulnerabilities
- XSS auditor in development and testing environments

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: Attackers might trick users into performing unwanted actions while authenticated.
**Mitigation**:
- Anti-CSRF tokens with each state-changing request
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Verify Origin and Referer headers
- Require confirmation for sensitive actions
- CSRF-specific testing in the CI/CD pipeline

### 4. Broken Authentication
**Risk Level**: Critical
**Description**: Vulnerabilities in the authentication system could allow unauthorized access.
**Mitigation**:
- JWT with proper signature validation
- Short token expiration times
- Secure cookie storage
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Strong password policies
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Regular security audits of authentication flows
- Session management and monitoring

### 5. Security Misconfiguration
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: Improper configuration of the application, framework, or server.
**Mitigation**:
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure cookie attributes
- Proper error handling without exposing details
- Regular security audits
- Infrastructure-as-code with security scanning
- Automated configuration validation
- Secure defaults for all components

### 6. Sensitive Data Exposure
**Risk Level**: Critical
**Description**: Exposure of sensitive data due to weak encryption or improper handling.
**Mitigation**:
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- HTTPS for data in transit
- Proper key management
- Data minimization (only store what's necessary)
- Redaction of sensitive information in logs
- Regular data classification audits
- Data loss prevention (DLP) tools integration

### 7. Insecure Deserialization
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: Processing of untrusted data when deserializing.
**Mitigation**:
- Input validation before deserialization
- Type checking for deserialized data
- Integrity checking on serialized objects
- Monitoring for suspicious deserialization activity

### 8. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: Using libraries or frameworks with known security issues.
**Mitigation**:
- Regular dependency scanning with OWASP Dependency-Check
- Automated dependency updates with security testing
- Vendor security announcements monitoring
- Software composition analysis in CI/CD pipeline

## Mitigation Strategy Implementation

The SecuritySentinel application implements these mitigations through:

1. **Input Validation Layer**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Authentication System**: Secure JWT implementation with proper validation
3. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive set of security headers
4. **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP implementation
5. **Database Security**: Parameterized queries and least privilege principle
6. **Error Handling**: Custom error handling without exposing system details
7. **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting system
8. **CI/CD Integration**: Security testing at every stage of deployment

## Regular Security Review Process

The security posture is regularly reviewed through:
1. Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Manual code reviews with security focus
3. Scheduled penetration testing
4. Vulnerability assessments
5. Security log analysis
6. Threat intelligence monitoring
7. Red team exercises

## Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Monitoring and alerting systems identify potential security incidents
2. **Analysis**: Security team evaluates the scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat from the environment
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security controls based on incident findings
