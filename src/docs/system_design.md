
# System Architecture - SecuritySentinel

## Overview
SecuritySentinel is a comprehensive security monitoring and vulnerability assessment platform built with a focus on real-time security measures, comprehensive vulnerability tracking, and secure coding practices.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend (React)
- **Technologies**: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Security Features**: 
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
  - XSS prevention through input sanitization
  - CSRF protection with tokens
  - Secure authentication with JWT

### API Layer / Security Gateway
- **Technologies**: Express.js middleware
- **Security Features**:
  - Request validation and sanitization
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
  - CORS configuration
  - Security headers (Helmet)

### Backend (Node.js)
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express
- **Security Features**:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Parameterized queries for database operations
  - Proper error handling

### Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL (relational database)
- **Security Features**:
  - Encrypted connections
  - Least privilege principle for database users
  - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
  - Sensitive data encryption

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time vulnerability tracking
- Threat modeling visualization
- Security score calculation
- Risk assessment reporting

## Data Flow
1. User requests are sent over HTTPS to the frontend
2. Frontend validates inputs and attaches authentication tokens
3. Requests pass through security middleware for additional validation
4. Backend processes requests and interacts with database using parameterized queries
5. Responses are sanitized before being sent back to the client

## Deployment Strategy
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
- HTTPS enforcement
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) implementation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Development & Security Tools

### Code Generation & Security Analysis
- **SonarQube**: Static code analysis to identify security vulnerabilities and code smells
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Automated scanning of dependencies for known CVEs
- **ESLint with security plugins**: Custom rules to catch security issues during development

### Security & Penetration Testing
- **OWASP ZAP / Burp Suite**: Automated and manual penetration testing
- **Snyk**: Continuous monitoring of dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **JWT Decoder**: Token inspection and validation

### Containerization & Secure Deployment
- **Docker**: Application containerization with minimal, secure base images
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration with security policies
- **Helm**: Secure configuration management for different environments

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**: 
  - Automated security scanning
  - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
  - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
  - Container image scanning
  - Secret detection

### Monitoring & Incident Response
- **ELK Stack**: Security event monitoring and alerting
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: System monitoring with security dashboards
- **Incident response playbooks**: Automated and manual response procedures
